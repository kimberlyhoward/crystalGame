You will be given a number at the start of the game.

There are 4 crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific number of points to your total score. Your number will be shown in the box below.

You win the game by matching your total number to computer's number. You lose the game if your number goes above the computer number.

The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
